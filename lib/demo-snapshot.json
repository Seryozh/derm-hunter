That personal battle, however, carved out a purpose for me. I wanted to find safe and effective solutions, not just for myself, but for the countless others facing the same trauma every day. \n\nMy services might seem familiar—acne and scar treatments, pigmentation treatments, fillers, neck liposuction, Botox—but the way I approach and administer them is unique. This distinct touch is a combination of my relentless research and innovative mindset, and it’s something that I strive to master and improve every day. I am here on a mission to create a new world in cosmetic medicine. A world where Doctors are compassionate, unsponsored, unbiased, and work their hardest for their patients.\n",

I'm Dr. Sasha Haddad , a board-certified Family Medicine doctor based in California.\n\nFrom the moment I applied to medical school to surviving the highs and lows of training, it's been a wild, rewarding journey. Now that I’ve completed residency, I’m here to share real advice, honest experiences, and practical tips to help guide and motivate you- whether you're dreaming of becoming a doctor or just looking to live a healthier life.\n\nThis channel is all about breaking down medicine in a way that’s relatable, myth-busting health misinformation, and giving you the tools to take better care of yourself.\n\nI was lucky to have mentors who shaped my path, and now, I hope to be that person for you.\n\nWelcome to the team, let’s get started! 👩🏻‍⚕️✨\n",

His medical training also afforded him the opportunity to perform surgery in Liberia, West Africa, Bangkok, Thailand, and Port Au Prince Haiti.\n\nDr. Webb completed a combined Neurosurgery/Orthopedic Spine Surgery fellowship at Texas Back Institute. TBI was the first practice in America to implant an artificial disc replacement.
